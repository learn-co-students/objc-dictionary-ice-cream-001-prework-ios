## Introduction

Some of the instructors are planning a summer ice cream party. Mark has collected some information on everyone's favorite ice cream flavors (including his own), but he needs help analyzing the list to know how much of each flavor to buy!

>Joe likes Peanut Butter and Chocolate  
Tim wants Natural Vanilla  
Sophie loves Mexican Chocolate  
Deniz only likes Natural Vanilla  
Tom will eat Mexican Chocolate  
Jim never answered so he's getting Natural Vanilla  
Mark â€” Cookies 'n Cream duh

## Instructions



5. Write the `countsOfIceCream` body which returns a dictionary of the number (value) of people who like each flavor of ice cream (key). Look at the `countsByIceCream` dictionary in the `FISAppDelegateSpec` file to better understand what the test is expecting.  
  **Hint:** *Try using the* `namesForIceCream:` *method that you just wrote to get a list of names for each ice cream flavor by calling it on* `self`. *This method returns an array of names which you can then count. Remember that you have to convert integer values to* `NSNumber` *in order to store them in a collection.*
